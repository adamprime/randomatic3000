## What Is This Beautiful Nonsense?

You know that moment when your team needs to decide who presents first, but nobody wants to volunteer, and suddenly everyone's very interested in their shoelaces? 

**RandoMatic 3000 has entered the chat.**

This is a retro-styled, over-engineered, delightfully unnecessary randomization tool featuring SIX different ways to let the universe make your decisions for you. Because sometimes democracy is just too much work.

## 🎪 The Magnificent Six

| Engine | Vibe | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| 🎡 **Wheel Spin** | County fair energy | Making Karen feel like she won something |
| 🎲 **Dice Roll** | Vegas, baby | Adding unnecessary drama to lunch orders |
| 🃏 **Card Shuffle** | Mysterious uncle at Thanksgiving | When you want to feel fancy |
| 🎱 **Lottery Balls** | "I've got a system" | Disappointing people, but randomly |
| 🪙 **Coin Cascade** | Binary chaos | Yes/no decisions that spiral out of control |
| 💾 **Crypto Random** | The Matrix called | Impressing people who don't know what entropy means |

## Features (That You Definitely Need)

- ✅ **2-20 options** — Because 21 choices is simply barbaric
- ✅ **Two modes** — Pick a winner OR determine complete order (for when one decision isn't enough chaos)
- ✅ **Run trials** — 25, 50, 100, or custom. For the statistically anxious among us.
- ✅ **Dark mode** — Because we're not savages
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** — Make impulsive decisions from anywhere
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** — Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Like the founders intended.
- ✅ **No cookies, no tracking** — Your indecision is between you and the void

## The Tech Stack

```
Framework: ✨ None ✨
Build tool: Opening index.html in a browser
Package manager: Your filing system
CI/CD: git push and pray
```

Vanilla JavaScript. No React. No Vue. No "npm install universe."

Just vibes and `crypto.getRandomValues()`.

---

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone the chaos
git clone git@github.com:adamprime/randomatic3000.git

# Enter the void
cd randomatic3000

# Start the application
open index.html
# (or just double-click it like it's 1999)
```

That's it. That's the whole setup. No `npm install`. No Docker. No Kubernetes cluster. Just files. Glorious, simple files.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
open tests/index.html
```

Tests are written in artisanal, hand-crafted vanilla JavaScript. 45 of them. They all pass. We checked.

## Why Does This Exist?

Look, someone needed to pick speaker order at church without the awkward "no, you go first" dance. And instead of just pulling names from a hat like a normal person, I built this.

**No regrets.**
